			Emboldened by our success with King's College and King's University, we are embarking on a journey of starting
	        schools for younger children. Having gone through the painful experience of finding good school for our children, we begin our
	        journey with a vision that children and their parents in Nepal do not have to look beyond their city of residence to find a good school.<br/>

	        Our mission is to operate at least one Ace School in every city in Nepal and inspire and support other education entrepreneurs to bring
	        about continual improvement in our schools and our school education systems.

	        Our journey begins with Ace School Kathmandu with the objective of providing learning environment that enables our children to
	        develop key competencies that prepare them well for challenges and opportunities that the modern-day world offers.<br/>
